                <h2>Why I Write</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>We all believe we have important ideas. But if we attempt to write them down, we struggle to express them clearly. The issue is not a lack of ideas; it is a lack of clarity. Without clarity, we do not really know what we think; we roam blindly through life in a muddle of half-formed ideas. <em>Writing</em> develops clarity and, with that, authenticity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before writing an essay, I have to understand which topics matter enough to write about. I use &ldquo;understand&rdquo; and not &ldquo;decide&rdquo; or &ldquo;research&rdquo; because it is not a choice to be made or a factual answer to be found; it is a process of self-evaluation and self-discovery: it forces me to reflect on what is important in my life and identify the problems worth solving. Completing this step, I have a list of topics requiring clarity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After choosing one, I brainstorm relevant ideas and write them out. This reveals blindspots and weaker ideas to be discarded. It also allows me to strengthen promising ideas and, when I discover synergies, connect them. If I am properly grounded and not writing to self-affirm but to discover, I spend days reflecting on opposing views and counter-arguments. With a matured perspective, I then reflect on my thesis: what is my overarching idea? Decreasingly chaotic iterations of these improvements and the concluding writing process, of conveying this idea well, give the piece its final structure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The finished essay is a direct imprint of my mind. I have not merely gained clarity on a topic; I have gained clarity on what I believe and why I believe it, giving rise to confidence and authentic action.</p>
