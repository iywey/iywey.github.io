                    <p>November 2023</p>
                    <p>In my deepest philosophy, my existence becomes an act of gratitude. I become fully aware of the mystery that we find ourselves in. I pay attention, carefully, to every moment, until I realise that there are no moments; there only is this one thing&mdash;that which we are&mdash;and it is unfolding right in front of our eyes, with us, as us.</p>

                    <p>When watching a performance, it is easy to pay attention to the highlights and get bored by the parts that lead up to it, but the experienced audience knows that all parts are worth paying attention to. Any separation of the performance into different parts is a mere illusion. There is no peak without the buildup. It&rsquo;s one motion, one expression that belongs together.</p>
                    
                    <p>Similarly we often pay attention to concerns about the future and lose track of what&rsquo;s in front of us, realizing not that that which is happening right now <em>is</em> the future. There is no future moment that will replace the current one. There are no separate moments at all. This, <em>this</em> what we are&mdash;<em>this</em> is what will always be. It simply changes, transforms, dances.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my deepest philosophy, I dance with it.</p>
