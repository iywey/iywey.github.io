                <h2>The Meeting Point</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>July 2023</p>
                    <p>The &ldquo;Law of Mirroring&rdquo; is a spiritual concept which says that our external world is a direct mirror of our internal reality. It&rsquo;d be great to live in such fantasy world, but reality doesn&rsquo;t support this. Bad things happen to good people and vice versa. Nonetheless, while no perfect correlation exists, a strong one does. Esotericism aside, our actions, which emanate from our internal reality, significantly shape our external world.</p>

                    <p>So in this sense, life meets us where we are. This insight is not novel; it&rsquo;s something we subconsciously know. Yet most of the time, we try to enforce the meeting coordinates. We have our goals (often subconscious), and we try to engineer circumstances to achieve them. In this process we often behave in inauthentic ways, as we fret about reaching our desired destination. Occasionally we get there, just to realise that something feels off.</p>
                    
                    <p>From a bird&rsquo;s-eye view, we can witness life meeting someone at this point. Yet that someone isn&rsquo;t us; it&rsquo;s a facade we created, hoping it would lead us to our desired destination. And indeed, we've reached this destination, only to find it unsatisfying&mdash;it&rsquo;s not ours.</p>
                    
                    <p>Having experienced this dissonance countless times, I understood that these fabricated meeting points are traps. I realised that it&rsquo;s better to relinquish rigid notions of where the meeting point should be and rather learn to understand my authentic self and be it. This way, when life meets me, I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is easier said than done because we&rsquo;re often presented the opportunity to manipulate the meeting point. The deal is clear: we get to choose, but we&rsquo;ll have to trade our authentic selves for it. Even though it sounds like a deal no one would consciously agree to, we still take it all the time. We believe we could trick the system and switch places with our persona at the last moment to claim the meeting point. It never works.</p>
                    
                    <p>It&rsquo;s difficult to let go of wanting to control the meeting point, because it requires a lot of faith&mdash;not in a higher power, but in ourselves: faith that our authentic selves are enough. We fear that fully embracing authenticity will lead to loss. In reality, the opposite is true&mdash;without authenticity, we never get to experience a life that is ours.</p>
                    
                    <p>So now, when faced with the choice to trade authenticity for control, I gather my courage and decline. I&rsquo;ll meet life where I am.</p>
