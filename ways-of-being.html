                <h2>Ways of Being</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>April 2023</p>
                    <p>Did you know there are different ways of <em>being</em> in the world? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aware that at times life has <em>felt</em> different than it does right now. But what you might now know is that you can choose how you experience every moment, resulting in feeling more control, agency, and <em>power</em>.</p>
                    <p>If you read my stuff, you&rsquo;re familiar with the idea of perception being a skill. We can change the way we habitually perceive certain events, and we can learn how to perceive in ways that are more accurate (closer to truth) and more conducive towards creating our desired outcomes (limitless instead of limiting).</p>
                    <p>The way you&rsquo;re used to interpreting certain events&mdash;such as when somebody acts in a way you don&rsquo;t like or you&rsquo;re among strangers and feel social anxiety or you fail accomplishing something that was important to you&mdash;strongly influences the way you feel and move forward in life.</p>
                    <p>Once you play around with perception and discover what kind of states are possible, you start to have this odd realisation, &ldquo;Hey, this is fucking insane. How did I not know I could feel this way?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>These states are what I call <em>ways of being</em>. You can experience a given moment in multiple, sometimes completely different ways. And some of them are <em>much better&nbsp;</em>than others. You feel better, everything comes easier to you, your mind is clearer, you&rsquo;re more relaxed yet still alert, you&rsquo;re more creative and productive&hellip; With training, you can <em>choose</em> in which states you reside.</p>
                    <p>The best way to describe peak mental state&mdash;the one I practice to stay in as long as possible&mdash;is that the question of the meaning of life becomes answered in the experiencing of it. Life feels so <em>sublime</em> that my existence itself is unquestionably, naturally justified. Every doubt I could ever have fades&mdash;it is self-evident that life, even if I only get to experience it for a brief moment in time, is truly worth living.</p></div>
