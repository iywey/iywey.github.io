                <div class="content">
                    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Wey Xie.</p>

                    <p>I completed my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Business Administration at the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management and worked at Deutsche Bank. I soon realised this wasn&rsquo;t for me and booked a oneway ticket to Ko Samui. I wanted to become a high stakes poker player because I believed the journey would require me to expand my understanding of the world and lead to the personal growth I was yearning for.</p>
                    
                    <p>Fast forward two years, I became one of the best. I travelled the world and had fun. But I missed meaning. Parents prepare their kids for failure but not for immediate success. I was living the life of my dreams but felt unsatisfied as it did not bring the sense of completion I expected.</p>
                    
                    <p>This led me to a two year long spiritual odyssey, where I lived alone on serene mountaintops and with monks in the middle of lush forests. I read philosophy and religion. I meditated and sought enlightenment. This journey revealed many facets of life, and it was a fairy tale I&lsquo;m blessed to have experienced, but it ended with me losing all my money, my relationship, and my mind.</p>
                    
                    <p>It&rsquo;s an interesting experience to lose your mind, and it&rsquo;s one hell of a journey to recover from that. I learned a lot from it and from the many hardships that followed.</p>
                    
                    <p>With much resilience and hard work, I rose back from every fall, and over the last years I have been coaching some of the brightest minds in poker to help them dominate the highest stakes in the world. My knowledge of poker theory is deep, but more important, through my own experience of systematically overcoming all the hardships that have been thrown at me, I&rsquo;ve become great at understanding how to structure your environment to best enable you to thrive.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the same time, I founded a software business to learn about entrepreneurship. It has been a success, and I&rsquo;m proud of it. I&rsquo;ve always held the belief that the majority habit of referring to statistics of failure was wrong, and I&rsquo;m happy to keep proving that in my own life and becoming an increasingly impressive example of survivorship bias.</p>
                    
                    <p>I live a truly great life. I have an abundance of free time and the confidence that I can succeed at whatever I choose. The difficulty lies in choosing the right things. I spend most of my time educating myself and experimenting how to best live in this weird society. I&rsquo;m constantly on the lookout for work I want to put my soul into. Hobbywise, I periodically obsess about something new and how to make the biggest gains in the fastest time. Once I reach a certain threshold, I usually get bored and move on fast. I cannot easily put to words how much I learn from this. Aside, one of my biggest passions is to analyse what businesses are doing and criticizing the shit out of them. I look forward to my next business to put more of my money where my mouth is.</p>
                    
                    <p>Until I fully commit to that, I&rsquo;m attending university because I believe in the exponential potential of fundamental knowledge. It&rsquo;s worth being as educated as you can be, especially in the sciences, not only because knowledge reveals the infinite layers of our magnificent world, but also because the problems I want to solve require it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Let&rsquo;s end this on the two things I love most: sports and relationships. The former I love more than my body can handle. The latter I love more than my mind can understand. I can be overly strict with myself and that can unjustly roll on to others, but it has rewarded me to have incredible people in my life who inspire me whenever I think of them. If you&rsquo;re one of them, I thank you for being you. If you&rsquo;re not but want to be, reach out.</p>
