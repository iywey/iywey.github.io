                    <p>Hello, I'm Wey Xie. Throughout my life, I've been drawn to challenging pursuits, eager to understand and navigate life's grand complexities. I've walked paths of academia, finance, high-stakes poker where I was counted among the best, and the roller-coaster world of tech entrepreneurship where I succesfully founded and exited my first company. I've also held the title of the world's number one Call of Duty player, a testament to my commitment in high-pressure environments.</p>
                    <p>While my accomplishments span various fields, they all converge at one point: the relentless pursuit of growth and understanding. My real passion lies in exploring the human condition, our potential, and how we can thrive in our exponentially evolving world.</p>
                        <p>My journey hasn't been just about achieving personal success; it's about reshaping how I, and hopefully others, understand life itself. It's about making sense of our existence and figuring out how best we can utilize the time we've been given. I invite you to join me as I continue to explore, learn, and share my insights. Here's to seeking truth, challenging norms, and redefining the human experience in this extraordinary world.</p>
