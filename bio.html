                <div class="content">
                    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Wey Xie.</p>

                    <p>I did my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Business Administration at the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management and worked at Deutsche Bank. I realised this wasn&rsquo;t for me and booked a oneway ticket to Ko Samui&mdash;I wanted to become a high stakes poker player because I believed the journey would require me to expand my understanding of the world and lead to the personal growth I was yearning for.</p>
                    
                    <p>Fast forward two years, I became one of the best. I travelled the world and had fun. But, I missed meaning. Parents prepare their kids for failure but not for immediate success. I was living the life of my dreams but felt unsatisfied as it did not bring the sense of completion I expected.</p>
                    
                    <p>This led me to a two year long spiritual oddysey, where I lived alone on mountaintops and with Buddhist monks in the middle of lush forests. I read philosophy and religion. I meditated and experimented with psychedelics. I sought enlightenment. This journey revealed many facets of life; it was a true fairy tale I&lsquo;m blessed to have experienced. But, it ended with me losing all my money, my relationship, and my mind.</p>
                    
                    <p>I returned back to Germany and went through desperate times. I felt like a complete failure, and my parents reinforced that by reminding me how I threw away my promising career for gambling and drugs. I was depressed and wanted to take my life. As I was planning that, one thought crossed my mind. I was curious to see what would happen if I gave life everything I had, one final time. I imagined what the best version of myself looked like and committed to a relentless pursuit of my highest ideal. I needed that, for that's the only thing that gave me a slimmer of a reason to live.</p>
                    
                    <p>I grinded hard and reintegrated into society. I got accepted into the leading computer science university in Germany. My goal was to work on BCIs (Brain-Computer Interfaces) and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).</p>
                    
                    <p>Yet, it was a painful contrast, being a high stakes poker player, the world my oyster, to now being back in university, broke, surrounded by 18-year-olds, living in a small dorm room with a roommate I disliked. And nobody cared about my past. I was nobody.</p>
                    
                    <p>But deep inside I knew who I was. After my first semester I decided I needed to do something about my situation and take care of myself first before changing the world. I started playing poker again and founded a poker and coaching business. I also founded a software company.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then, I had a spinal cord injury. For over six months, I was locked to the floor of my dorm room. Again, I found myself in a situation asking me to give up. But, having made it through hell once, I knew I could do it again. I used my time to build out my businesses and educate myself by reading lots of books. The situation worsened when I made the decision to get operated on my spine, as the operation went bad and I suffered nerve damage. If I experienced hell before, then this third visit was hell^10. Through a lot of hard work and perseverance, things gradually got better.</p>
                    
                    <p>My businesses were successful, and I spent the last two years accumulating wealth and taking care of my health and the structure of my life. I&rsquo;m in a good position now. My life isn&rsquo;t perfect, but my adventure so far has allowed me to gain wisdom that I&rsquo;ll carry with me for the rest of it. I enjoy a lot of freedom in how I choose to spend my time, and it&lsquo;s something I reflect on deeply. Over the last years, I&lsquo;ve tried out many things and outgrew many existential crises. I&lsquo;ve learned a lot. It&lsquo;s been a luxury to live this life.</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally, I decided to return to my original mission. I want to work on BCIs&mdash;my goal being to enhance our cognition and bring us closer to digital immortality. It&lsquo;s a big word and a big dream, but I&lsquo;d rather dream big and fail than not having tried. So I&rsquo;m going back to university. I might get a PhD.</p>
                    
                    <p>Still, I'll continue building businesses to create wealth, invest to grow it, and read and write to further expand my understanding of this mesmerising world we live in. I&lsquo;ll continue doing lots of sports because sports are the best. And while many might know me as a disciplined, serious individual, I can be silly and goofy around the people who I love and who love me. I&lsquo;ll continue seeking out and deepening the relationships that make life worth living.</p>
