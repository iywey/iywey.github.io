                    <p>April 2023</p>
                    <p>The most important realization I have made in my life is that everything is one. Where we see separate things, there are none; there is just existence unfolding. Understanding this is enlightenment.</p>

                    <p>There is no sense in being upset about certain aspects of life if you are happy about others. They&rsquo;re all interconnected&mdash;spatial and temporal manifestations of one web of causes and effects.</p>

                    <p>For example, you might be upset about the way your parents raised you, but then you also wouldn&rsquo;t have had the experiences you most cherish. Love some experiences, hate others&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t make sense; it all belongs together.</p>

                    <p>Or, you might be dating a girl, and there are some traits about her that you really don&rsquo;t like but others that you love. She can&rsquo;t have one without the other. This is how she is. Love her or hate her, but if you love her, love her for all of her.</p>

                    <p>All this doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t participate in shaping the future&mdash;it is ours to shape. This also isn't about merely accepting the bad as a part of life. No, it's way deeper than that: this is the realization that there's only <em>one inseperable process</em>, and <strong>you are <em>it</em></strong>.</p>
