                    <p>I was always good at maths. When I was in high school, I took the most advanced maths classes and aced them all. But it was only recently I understood what maths really is. I used to think that it was this abstract subject with fun puzzles and that solving those would in some rare cases be applicable to real world problems. I was good at solving these problems, but I didn&rsquo;t know what maths is.</p>

<p>Maths is the universal language. It&rsquo;s based on rigid systems that are absolutely true under clearly defined axioms. The value of mathematical aptitude lies not in being good at manoeuvring specific systems but rather in the ability to conceive of logical structures and to deeply think about them.</p>

<p>Maths might look abstract, but it isn&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s the fundamental layer of reality. It&rsquo;s more fundamental than the physical world we observe. Mathematical symbols and areas are not separate from the physical world; they are prior: they are placeholders that serve as the space to analyse all physical worlds, even those we are yet to discover.</p>

<p>Maths is also the optimal training ground for the mind. It allows us to create ideas in our minds that we otherwise could not have fathomed to think about, lest understand.</p>

<p>Ultimately, maths is the science of the absolute. It is our best and closest effort to come to an understanding of a possible objective reality. Its description will finally be delivered by physics, but it will be delivered on the foundation of maths, in the language of maths. Maths is not just the universal language; maths is the language of the universe.</p>
